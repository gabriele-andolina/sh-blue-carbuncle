                I had visited my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, 
                with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. <br> 
                He was sitting by the window, a steaming cup of tea in his hands. Close by him lay a worn and dirty 
                hat he had been examining with his lens. <br> <br>
                "You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you." <br> 
                "Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results."

                This hat you see here came to me with a strange companion, a goose. 
                On Christmas morning, they were left on the street by a man running away from a brawl. 
                Then, they were found and brought to me by Mr Peterson, my neighbor who works as 
                a commissionaire at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. <br>
                Before I tell you about that, however, let us see if your deduction skills have weakened 
                since you married and moved out! <br> <br>
                Below, you can see ten observations we can rather easily make as we study this hat. <br>
                Of course, for each observation we can also make a deduction. <br>
                It is now your job, dear Dr. Watson, to see if you can choose the right one. After you have
                accomplished this task, I will tell you more of this hat and goose.

                I had visited my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, 
                with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. <br> 
                He was sitting by the window, a steaming cup of tea in his hands. Close by him lay a worn and dirty 
                hat he had been examining with his lens. <br> <br>
                "You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you." <br> 
                "Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results."

                "This hat you see here came to me with a strange companion, a goose. 
                On Christmas morning, they were left on the street by a man running away from a brawl. 
                Then, they were found and brought to me by Mr Peterson, my neighbour who works as 
                a commissionaire at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. <br>
                Before I tell you about that, however, let us see if your deduction skills have weakened 
                since you married and moved out! <br> <br>
                Below, you can see ten observations we can rather easily make as we study this hat. <br>
                Of course, for each observation we can also make a deduction. <br>
                It is now your job, dear Dr. Watson, to see if you can choose the right one. After you have
                accomplished this task, I will tell you more of the hat and goose.""

                "Alright, you have earned your story. On Christmas morning, while returning home from some 
                small jollification, Mr Peterson saw a tallish man being assailed by a knot of roughs. This man
                then raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window
                behind him. Mr Peterson ran toward him to help but he, shocked at having broken the window, dropped 
                his goose and hat and vanished into the small streets at the back of Tottenham Court Road. Tied to
                the bird's left leg was a small card reading 'For Mrs. Henry Baker.' A very common name here in London, isn't it?

                As Holmes was speaking, the door flew open and Peterson rushed into the apartment with
                flushed cheeks and an astonished face.
                "The goose, sir! The goose! Look what my wife has found in its crop!", the man gasped as

                John Horner, a plumber, was accused by James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, to steal it after
                doing some maintenance work in the room. Mr Ryder had left Mr Horner in the room where he later 
                found the Countess' jewel casket open and empty. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, corroborated
                Ryder's testimony."

                I had visited my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, 
                with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. <br> 
                He was sitting by the window, a steaming cup of tea in his hands. Close by him lay a worn and dirty 
                hat he had been examining with his lens. <br> <br>
                "You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you." <br> 
                "Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results."
